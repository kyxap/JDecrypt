This App was created for one of my project (PageStore) for automation one of the rutine process - brutforcing the correct asnwer for randomly generated code while intallation server side of the product.

It has only simple functionallity: waiting for input Code and by Decrypt button will give the Password for product installation.
For example we have Administrator Code (1NF3Z58N3805F47) and if we will generet this one we will get the A9999999999AAAA and after it will use for continues the program installation.

I have selected Java for this tool because we have Windows and MacOS servers and with Java we will have platform independent.

This app was used by QA\Dev teams and some of the Managers while they showing the app to new clients.
